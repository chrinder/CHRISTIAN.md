# Philosophy

1. **Readability over cleverness** - Code is read far more than it is written. Optimize for the reader.
2. **Simplicity over sophistication** - Prefer flat folders, simple names, and minimal abstraction.
3. **Explicit over implicit** - When you deviate from defaults, explain why.
4. **Tests as documentation** - Test class + method names should read as behavior statements.
5. **Leverage existing solutions** - Use platform and library capabilities before inventing custom patterns.
