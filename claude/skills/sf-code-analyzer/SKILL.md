# Salesforce Code Analyzer

Run code analysis with smart rule selection based on project type.

## Determine the target

- If `$ARGUMENTS` is a file or directory path, scan that path
- If files were just created or modified in this session, scan those specific files
- If no target is obvious, scan `force-app/main/default`

## Determine which scans to run

First check if the user explicitly asked for a specific scan:
- `$ARGUMENTS` contains "security" → security scan only
- `$ARGUMENTS` contains "cleancode" → clean code scan only

If no explicit choice, **detect the project type** to decide:

1. Read `sfdx-project.json` in the project root
2. Look for managed package signals:
   - `namespace` field is set (non-empty)
   - Package entries with `versionName` / `versionNumber`
   - A `security-review/` directory exists
   - Project name or path suggests AppExchange (e.g. contains "package", "managed", "appexchange")
3. Decision:
   - **Managed package detected** → run both security and clean code scans
   - **No package signals** (scratch org project, unlocked package, loose source) → run clean code scan only

When in doubt, just run clean code. Security scans are slow and noisy on projects that will never go through AppExchange review.

## Security scan (AppExchange rules)

```bash
sf code-analyzer run --rule-selector "Recommended:Security" "AppExchange" "flow" "sfge" --output-file security-review/scans/code-analyzer-security.csv --target <TARGET>
```

## Clean code scan (opinionated PMD rules)

Uses the bundled [pmd-ruleset.xml](pmd-ruleset.xml) via [code-analyzer.yaml](code-analyzer.yaml).

```bash
sf code-analyzer run --rule-selector "PMD:OpinionatedSalesforce" --output-file code-analyzer-cleancode.csv --target <TARGET>
```

## After scanning

- Report findings grouped by severity (1 = critical, 5 = info)
- For each finding: file, line, rule name, and the message
- If no findings: confirm the code is clean
- Don't auto-fix without asking — just report

## False positives

When a finding is a false positive, suppress it in code with a comment explaining why:

```java
// Note: Input is required=true in schema — Agentforce won't call without it
@SuppressWarnings('PMD.MissingNullCheckOnSoqlVariable')
```

Document recurring false positives in `security-review/false-positives.md` if the file exists.
